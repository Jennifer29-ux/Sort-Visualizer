This Project was done under the superivision of Professor [Glory Lee](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N0kz7wFTWb40wPulzivI6D-FXZl_0BcZ/view?usp=sharing) at Deakin University)

This is a program  developed in C++ that sorts random values, drawing each step to visualize the process using the Sorting algorithms. I have used Selection, Bubble and Cocktail to sort random values by using different keys to perform the operations
